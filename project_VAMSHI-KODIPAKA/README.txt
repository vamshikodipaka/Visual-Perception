Designing a Kohonen Neural Network: learning rate, weights, clustering, classification

Dataset, train set, test set:: Patient/Control classification

To run the code kindly do the following:

1. Change your current working directory of MATLAB to this folder.
2. The 'main.m' file has all the three projects implemented.
	The ouput can be viewed in command window.
	The convergence plots are plotted.
	Type 'help main' for more details.

	The training and test are done by two functions
		kohonen_train 
		kohonen_test

	************(Observe that this testing is performed on:: test_six_vamshi.txt)****************

	Type 'help kohonen_train' or 'help kohonen_test' to more about those functions and example to run them explicitly.
